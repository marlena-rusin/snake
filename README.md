# Snake Game

Welcome to the classic and popular game of Snake! In this game, the player controls a snake to collect as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with obstacles and their own tail.

## How to Play

To start the game, simply launch the application. The snake will automatically start moving, and the player can control the direction of the snake using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The goal is to collect as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

As the snake eats the food, its body will grow longer, making it more difficult to maneuver around the game board. The game ends when the snake collides with an obstacle or its own tail.
